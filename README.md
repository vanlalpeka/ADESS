## Introduction
This is the code for my master's thesis: <a href="Master Thesis with affidavit.pdf">Anomaly Detection Using an Ensemble with Simple Sub-models, 2024</a>.
The algorithm explores the effectiveness of an ensemble of simple sub-models like linear regression in detecting anomalies.

## Usage
1. Install the package

2. Run with --help to see the parameters

3. Run. The mean AUROC and the number of submodels executed with the budgeted time (default: 600 secs) are printed.


## Results
The AUROCs of the runs reported in the thesis are stored in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lLax3dy0JjQOxW_wwGM35UwRHdO8CJlR9QSlvxNbVNc/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet</a>
